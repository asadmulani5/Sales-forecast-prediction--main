********************** SALES FORECAST PREDICITION USING MACHINE LEARNING **********************

This project is a web based application which is helpfull for pharamcy owners to know the stock better about the pharmaceutical goods.

It is built using ML model- XGBoost which is supervised algorithm, it helps to understand data and make better decisions. It works better on larger datasets. The user interface is built using HTML/CSS and Javascript. It forecasts the value of sale done within the range of dates and the category selected of the product, according to the dataset WHO has divided the pharmaceutical products in 8 categories.
